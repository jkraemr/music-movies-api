  </header>

  <main>

    <p>The <em>Music Movies API</em> is the complete server-side component of the <em>myMusicMovies</em> web
      application providing users with access to information about different music movies including details about
      genres, actors, directors, artists, and more. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information,
      and create a list of their favorite music movies.</p>

    <p>The <em>Music Movies API</em> consists of a RESTful API and non-relational database built using Node.js, Express,
      and MongoDB and will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) are used
      to retrieve data from the database and store that data in a non-relational way. Whenever users are interacting
      with the <em>myMusicMovies</em> web application, the <em>Music Movies API</em> including the server, business
      logic, and respective business layers, will process their requests and performing operations against the data in
      the database.
